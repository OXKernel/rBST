# rBST
Randomized Binary Search Tree

The rBST design is not as fast as the unordered\_map or map
containers in STL. It is provided here just for reference.
Feel free to modify and improve it if you wish.

Note that without randomizing the input, there is no hope
for it to work for large input.

Here is a sample run:

starting test
rBST 47.000000
unordered_map 17.000000
std::map 15.000000

For 10m datapoints.
